## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Raet-Beaufort-IAM-API-Identity_ is a _target_ connector. _Raet-Beaufort_ provides a set of REST API's that allow you to programmatically interact with its data. The HelloID connector uses the API endpoints listed in the table below.

| Endpoint                                          | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| /iam/v1.0/users(employeeId={employeeId})          | GET user    |
| /iam/v1.0/users(employeeId={employeeId})/identity | PATCH user  |

This connector is able to write back the identity of a provisioned user (to another target like Azure AD or MS AD) to the user of Raet Beaufort. This field can be used in Beaufort for single Sign-On purposes. 
Also keep in mind that this endpoint will be migrated to the new IAM-API later on.

More information about the Users endpoint of the Raet Users Endpoint can be found on:
- [Community visma](https://community.visma.com/t5/Kennisbank-Youforce-API/IAM-user-endpoint/ta-p/430073)
- [Swagger](https://api.youforce.com/documentation/index.html?urls.primaryName=Youforce.IAM.Api#/Users)



The following lifecycle actions are available:

| Action             | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| create.ps1         | Correlation on person                |
| delete.ps1         | Empty configured field(s) on person  |
| update.ps1         | Update configured field(s) on person |
| configuration.json | Default _configuration.json_         |
| fieldMapping.json  | Default _fieldMapping.json_          |

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest version of this connector requires **new api credentials**. To get these, please follow the [Visma documentation](https://community.visma.com/t5/Kennisbank-Youforce-API/Visma-Developer-portal-een-account-aanmaken-applicatie/ta-p/527059) on how to register the App and grant access to client data.  
- [ ] Enabling of the User endpoints.
  - By default, the User endpoints aren't "enabled". This has to be requested at Raet.
- [ ] ClientID, ClientSecret and tenantID
  - Since we are using the API we need the ClientID, ClientSecret and tenantID to authenticate with RAET IAM-API Webservice.
- [ ] Dependent account data in HelloID.
  - Please make your provisioned system dependent on this Users Target Connector and make sure that the values needed to be written back are stored on the account data (e.g UserPrincipalName).

### Remarks
> [!TIP]
> Only the 'identity' field can be updated, no other fields are (currently) supported.
> 
> When the value in Raet equals the value in HelloID, the action will be skipped (no update will take place).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently (08-12-2022) Changes you make with this connector through the API are not visible within the Youforce portal. If you want to check if the update is succesfull please retreive the edited user or try the SSO connection.


> [!NOTE]
> Currently (14-02-2024) it is not possible to empty the identity in Youforce. The endpoint will give a error. By default `ExternalID@Domain.com` will be filled.
